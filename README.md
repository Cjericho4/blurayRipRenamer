# blurayRipRenamer

Quick python script to rename the Rips from MakeMKV as DVD/Bluray rips are rarely the right order from the bluray.

Friends map was found [here]() thanks to wurzl.

To use this script you can run `./RenameBluraRip.py <PathToCSV> <PathToRippedFiles>` on a linux/mac/wsl terminal and it will remap all files that match the mapper.
